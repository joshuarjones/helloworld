<p>Raleigh is ranked the # 3rd place to live in the U.S.  This is due to its strong growth and high quality of life, per U.S. News.  Personally I like the quality of life and you 2.5 hours from the beaches on the coast to the east and 2.5 hours away from the mountains to the west.  It's the best of both worlds. </p>
